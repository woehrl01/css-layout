A node with margin\nwill offset itself from the bounds of its parent but also offset the\nlocation of any siblings. The margin of a node contributes to the total size\nof its parent if the parent is auto sized.</p>\n<p><controls prop="margin"></controls></p>\n<p><strong>PADDING</strong> affects the size of the node it is applied to. Padding in Yoga acts as if\n<code class="language-text">box-sizing: border-box;</code> was set. That is padding will not add to the total size\nof an element if it has an explicit size set. For auto sized nodes padding will increase\nthe size of the node as well as offset the location of any children.</p>\n<p><controls prop="padding"></controls></p>\n<p><strong>BORDER</strong> in Yoga acts exactly like padding and only exists as a seperate property so\nthat higher level frameworks get a hint as to how thick to draw a border. Yoga however\ndoes not do any drawing so just uses this information during layout where border\nacts exactly like padding.</p>\n<p><controls prop="border"></controls></p>'}}}});
